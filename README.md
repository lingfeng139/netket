NetKet is an open-source project delivering cutting-edge methods for the study
of many-body quantum systems with artificial neural networks and machine learning techniques.
It is a Python library built on C++ primitives.

## Installation and Usage
Netket supports MacOS and Linux. The reccomended way to install it in a non-conda python environment is: 
```
pip install netket[all]
``` 
The `[all]` after netket will install all extra dependencies of netket. 
We reccomend to install netket with all it's extra dependencies, which are documented below. 
However, if you do not have a working MPI compiler in your PATH this installation will most likely fail because
it will attempt to install `mpi4py`, which enables MPI support in netket.
If you are only starting to discover netket and won't be running extended simulations, you can forego MPI by 
installing netket with the command
```
pip install netket # or pip install netket[jax] 
```

Netket is also available on conda-forge. To install netket in a conda-environment you can use:
```
conda install conda-forge::netket
```
Conda by default ships pre-built binaries for recent versions of python.
The default blas library is openblas, but mkl can be enforced. 
The conda library is linked to anaconda's `mpi4py`, therefore we do not reccomend to use this installation
method on computer clusters with a custom MPI distribution.

### Extra dependencies
When installing netket with pip, you can pass the following extra variants as square brakets. You can install several of them by separating them with a comma.
 - '[dev]': installs development-related dependencies such as black, pytest and testing dependencies
 - '[mpi]': Installs `mpi4py` to enable multi-process parallelism. Requires a working MPI compiler in your path
 - '[jax]': Installs `jax` to enable jax-based neural networks
 - '[all]': Installs `mpi`, `jax` and `mpi4jax` which is required to use mpi with jax machines.

Since version 3, in addition to the built-in machines, you can also use [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) to define your custom neural networks.

### MPI Support
Depending on the library you use to define your machines, distributed computing through MPI might
or might not be supported. Please see below:
  - **netket** : distributed computing through MPI support can be enabled by installing the package `mpi4py` through pip or conda.
  - **jax**    : distributed computing through MPI is supported natively only if you don't use Stochastic Reconfiguration (SR). If you need SR, you must install [mpi4jax](https://github.com/PhilipVinc/mpi4jax). Please note that we advise to install mpi4jax  with the same tool (conda or pip) with which you installed netket.
  - **pytorch** : distributed computing through MPI is enabled if the package `mpi4py` is isntalled. Stochastic Reconfiguration (SR) cannot be used when MPI is enabled. 

To check whever MPI support is enabled, check the flags 
```python
# For standard MPI support
>>> netket.utils.mpi_available
True

# For faster MPI support with jax and to enable SR + MPI with Jax machines
>>> netket.utils.mpi4jax_available
True

```
